🌎 Hawa'na
Hawa'na is a real-time environmental dashboard that displays Air Quality Index (AQI) and Gamma Radiation levels for selected cities around the world. Built with React and powered by public APIs, the project aims to raise awareness about pollution and radiation exposure in urban environments.

✨ Features
- Live air quality readings (AQI, PM2.5, PM10)
- Real-time gamma radiation levels (µSv/h)
- Smart fallback to cached radiation data when live data is unavailable
- Expected radiation level indicators
- Dark & Light mode toggle
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

🗺️ Monitored Cities
- Chernobyl
- Jeddah
- Reykjavik
- Lahore
- Rome
